# Finance Analytics Tableau Project
## Objective:
The goal of this Tableau project is to analyze financial performance across different
countries, products, and time periods, using key financial metrics such as sales, profit,
cost of goods sold (COGS), and discounts.

## Steps and Tasks
Task 1: Data Import and Preparation
Task 2: Visualizations
Task 3: Filters and Interactivity
Task 4: Dashboard Creation

## Final Output:
By the end of this project, you’ll have:
● Bar Charts showing the financial performance of different countries.
● Line Graphs visualizing the trend in sales and profit over time.
● Heat Maps to understand the impact of discount bands on sales.
● Scatter Plots to see the relationship between gross sales and discounts.
These visualizations will provide comprehensive insights into financial performance
and profitability across different segments, countries, and time periods.
